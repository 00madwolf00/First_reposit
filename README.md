# First_reposit
This reposit will represent all the information programs and code of my first major project in python.
The purpose of this project is to analyze audio samples and provide graphs based on the analyzed audio.
The Program accepts .mp3 and .wav files and graphs charts depicting the frequency and resonance of the sound input.
Although if it is an .mp3 file first it will convert the file to a .wav file then perform all other task.
This program also includes a button within a gui that allows you to load an audio sample into the progam and a previous and next button that allows you to cycle through each graph generated.
